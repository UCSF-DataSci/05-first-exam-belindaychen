#DS217 Midterm Bioinformatics Project
This project contains three directories: data, scripts, and results." 

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains input data files
  - random_sequence.fasta: Input FASTA sequence file
  
- `scripts/`: Contains analysis scripts
  - generate_fasta.py: Script to generate random DNA sequences
  - dna_operations.py: Core DNA manipulation functions
  - find_cutsites.py: Script to identify restriction enzyme cut sites
  
- `results/`: Contains analysis outputs
  - cutsite_summary.txt: Summary of identified cut sites

## Usage

The scripts in this project are designed to work with DNA sequence data and identify
restriction enzyme cut sites. Each script can be run independently or as part of a
complete workflow.
